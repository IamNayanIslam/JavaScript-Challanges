What is this repository? 
<strong>JavaScript Challenges Level 1</strong>
<br/>
<br/>

This repository documents my journey in building a strong foundation in JavaScript through daily problem-solving challenges. I collaborate with Gemini, an AI Chatbot, to generate and discuss problems, but I solve all the code myself. My goal is to complete at least 100 problems in this process.

Here I will list the problems with a brief line of description.
